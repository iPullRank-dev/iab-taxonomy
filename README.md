IAB Content Taxonomy as a JSON payload

The content taxononmy from IAB exists as a [PDF](https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Content_Taxonomy_T1-T2_for_Public_Review.pdf.pdf) which is not ideal for a data schema. Although iPullRank has no affiliation with IAB, the content taxonomy for public review is in sharable PDF. iPullRank loves content taxonomies and wanted to provide a JSON payload of this data as it's a great starting point and can be useful for many applications. 

Google [recently annouced they are moving away from FLoC and onto a Topics](https://blog.google/products/chrome/get-know-new-topics-api-privacy-sandbox/). Their starting point is the v2 IAB content taxonomy which has now been converted to a JSON payload. Enjoy!
